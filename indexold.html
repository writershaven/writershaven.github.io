<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The Writer’s Haven aims to create a space for students who are interested in exploring and developing their skills in writing, storytelling, and literary discussions. The mission of the club is to encourage creativity and provide a supportive environment for students to express themselves through various forms of writing. The topics to be included are different forms of writing, such as poetry, short stories, novellas, and essays. We would discuss multiple genres of writing and storytelling, as well as share some pointers on how to write.</p>
